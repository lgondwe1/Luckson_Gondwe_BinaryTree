Binary Tree that performs given operations in order to give a total for the tree solved in the program. 
The node class is created to represent each node in the binary tree. The node has three attributes: value: the operator(Ex:+,-,*,/,^,%), raising an error for unsupported operators. Left: A reference to the left child (which is another Node object or None if there is no child). Right: A reference to the right child (also a Node or None).
The evaluate function takes a node and recursively computes the result of the expression by Checking whether the node is an OperandNode (a leaf node containing a number). If so, it returns that number. If it's an OperatorNode, it Recursively evaluates the left and right subtrees to compute their values.
Applies the operator stored in the current node to these values (e.g., adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides, raises to the power, or takes the modulus).
The function also contains error handling for division by zero, raising an exception if such a case occurs.
